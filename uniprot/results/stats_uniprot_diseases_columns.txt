Disease    -> Genetic disease acronym (cancers excluded)
VarNumber  -> Total number of kinase domain variants associated to the disease
GeneNumber -> Total number of kinases associated to the disease
GeneList   -> Gene names
KnownA     -> Number of variants known to be activating  
KnownD     -> Number of variants known to be deactivating  
KnownR     -> Number of variants known to be resistance  
PredA      -> Number of variants predicted as activating (AIvLD predictor)
PredD      -> Number of variants predicted as deactivating (AIvLD predictor)
PredA%     -> Fraction from the total number of variants (PredA / VarNumber)
PredD%     -> Fraction from the total number of variants (PredD / VarNumber)
UnkPredA   -> Number of unknown variants predicted to be activating (AIvLC predictor)
UnkPreD    -> Number of unknown variants predicted to be deactivating ("AIvLD predictor)
UnkPredA%  -> Fraction from the total number of unkown variants (UnkPredA / (VarNumber - KnownA + KnownD))
UnkPredD%  -> Fraction from the total number of unkown variants (UnkPredD / (VarNumber - KnownA + KnownD))
KnownVariants -> One of 4 classes: 
			"Only activating" = all 'known' variants are activating,
			"Only deactivating" = all 'known' variants are deactivating,
			"Both" = there both activating and deactivating known variants,
			"None" = there are no known variants
