# Introduction (small one)

The file **create_svg_20230208.py** comes with 3 python functions and a dictionary with annotations.
You will also have to use the second file, which contains an alignment, as input for the script.

## Required libraries/software

Python 2.7. (sorry folks)

import svgwrite

from Bio import AlignIO
