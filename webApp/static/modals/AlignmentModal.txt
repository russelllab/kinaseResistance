This panel displays the alignment of the input kinase sequence with
other human kinase sequences. Known functional variants are then mapped
onto the alignment. Hover on the variants to know more about them.<br>
<kbd>Sort alignment by</kbd> represents the information (known functional or PTM)
based on which the alignment will be sorted.<br>
<kbd>Show top N kinases</kbd> reflects the top N kinases to be displayed in the alignment.
(recommended 10-100).<br>
<kbd>Window Size</kbd> represents the number of positions before or
after the variant site to be displayed in the alignment (recommended 10-30).
