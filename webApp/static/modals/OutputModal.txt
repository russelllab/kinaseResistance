This panel displays the prediction results and
known information about the input variants.<br>
<kbd>Info:</kbd> Known variant and PTM information at the equivalent site in other kinases.<br>
<kbd>View:</kbd> Click this to view the individual variant entry.<br>
<kbd>Gene Name:</kbd> Gene of the kinase.<br>
<kbd>Variant:</kbd> Input variant.<br>
<kbd>Kinase domain region:</kbd> Kinase domain region.<br>
<kbd>Known ADR:</kbd> Known functional variants at the given site.<br>
<kbd>Verdict (activating vs deactivating):</kbd> 
Likelihood if the given variant is activating or deactivating the kinase. 
Values in paranthesis refer to the prediction confidence (Low, Medium, High). 
Variants with uncertain verdicts are marked as "ambigous" and the ones that
lie outside the kinase domain as '-'. <br>
<kbd>Verdict (resistance):</kbd> 
Likelihood if the given variant is resistant the kinase. 
Values in paranthesis refer to the prediction confidence (Low, Medium. High). 
Variants that lie outside the kinase domain as '-'. <br>
