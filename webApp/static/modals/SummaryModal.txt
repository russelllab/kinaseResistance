This panel displays the summary of the input variant, predicted probabilities and known functional
and PTM information in all kinases.
</p>
<p>
<kbd>Predictions (Activating vs Deactivating)</kbd>: These predictions represent a typical situation 
when one has what is believed to be a functional variant (e.g. observed many times in a cohort or dataset) 
and wishes to distinguish these two possibilities.
</p>
<p>
<kbd>Predictions (Activating vs Deactivating vs Neutral)</kbd>: These predictions are more 
reflective of a situation where one does not know if a variant is functional at all 
and thus one needs to predict neutrals.
</p>
<p>
<kbd>Predictions (Resistance vs Not)</kbd>: This predicts if a given variant is resistant or not.
<strong>Note</strong>: Given that this predictor lacks information about activating and deactivating information,
users may ignore its predictions when other predictors predict the variant to be
strongly deactivating (eg: variants occuring at most conserved residues like the Catalytic Lysine,
DFG-motif, etc., which are associated with loss of kinase activity.)
</p>
<p>
<kbd>Known functional and PTM information in all kinases</kbd>: Known functional and PTM information 
of the variant site and adjacent positions (+/- 2 in the alignment) in other kinases.
