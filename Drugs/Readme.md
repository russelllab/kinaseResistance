# A Dataset of Protein Kinase Inhibitors in Clinical Trials
Data was retrieved from [PKIDB](https://www.icoa.fr/pkidb/) on 30 June 2023 (**pkidb_2023-06-30.tsv**).

Our findings suggest that 
- for 293 out of 505 kinases there are drugs already on the market
- for an additional 7 there are compounds in development
- earlier candidates likely for many of the remainder

The script **Getting_Drugs.py** was used to get this information.
